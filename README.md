# Covid-19-app
We want to build a covid 19 statistic webapp.
We will get the covid statistic from this api: 'https://about-corona.net/'
and we will get the list of countries per continent from this api 'https://github.com/hengkiardo/restcountries' after working with two API`s,
we want to display our data on graphs,we will use chartJS library.
